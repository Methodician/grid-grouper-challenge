# GridGrouper

I was asked to do a simple whiteboard challenge while interviewing for 6 Degrees Health. While I'm not a proponent of whiteboard challenges for developer interviews, I became obsessed with the challenge and ended up building this app.

While I went off on my own path, I'm proud of the ultimate outcome. The code isnt' super-terse. I'm uncertain how performant the algorithm will be, but I'd say decent. It's definitely highly flexible. The commented out grid is the initial challenge posed and the larger grid shows that the system I came up with can easily handle additional situations without modification.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.3.

## Development server

First run `npm install` to ensure all the relevant packages are available.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
